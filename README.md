# my-notes
I am Mohammad Salhab 23 years old , undergraduat Computer Science student I love coding alot and I am intrested in machine learning and Data Science , I am a good learner and I will keep learn as I still alive.

### What I learned from reading a good developer mindset article
 that, first of all you have to know the purpose of the project and to **anderstand the problem** you have to solve then you will be simple as possible in **planning and writing** the code, and you ==should not show off your self== by complex the code, you should have a **simple mindset** and to priotarize your work and predict future problems and needs.
### Try to be more consistant than means you have to make you not add code or features unless you make sure that are required.
